Let us read the fuel efficiency data that ships with Stata

To study how fuel efficiency depends on weight it is useful to transform the dependent variable from "miles per gallon" to "gallons per 100 miles"

We then obtain a fairly linear relationship

The regression equation estimated by OLS is

Thus, a car that weighs 1,000 pounds more than another requires on average an extra 1.4 gallons to travel 100 miles.  
          
That's all for now!
